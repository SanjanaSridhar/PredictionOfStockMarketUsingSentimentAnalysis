blindly sell as much as posssible.
To recover all my losses (around 1.25L) how much money I need to invest. As of now, I have jst 175 Rs. to invest and in that also, 15-20 Rs. are in danger as I have mcdowell in intradaY at 1810 and CMP is 1800 o below :( What target we can see.
Also, is it not better to buy in Options to get more profit and to recover the loss in few days. Had I have money, I would have made 500% profit in 840 CE in few days :(.
So we can see 1100+ in 1-2 months?.
now 1476 book profit stock not performing as..
what will be the record date for dividend usually?.
my average cost is below 100 as of now so adding is always a careful point - my game plan is to have two dividends - theory is that two dividends and a possible bonus will add to the price sooner or later - bonus i hear may come in April but.
results are on april 17th and AGM on june 28th. Q1 on july18 therefore this this time is the best to buy as final div and ist quarter div and this year if any bonus will accrue. probability of bonus is high - infact if you dont see the bonus.
i will restart buying at 1450-58 levels - hope it gets there..but in any case expect this to rebound to 1600 levels on results day and day after.
