 ACC: Considering broader perspective, it is clearly seen that the stock has broken all its near term supports. A sharp decline in prices on Monday led to a closing below its 'weekly 89 EMA'. A closing below '89 EMA' is considered as a sign of caution for the bulls. Further, the monthly 'RSI-Smoothened' oscillator is negatively poised.All these evidences indicate the possibility of further downside in the intermediate term. However, due to a sharp fall in the last few trading sessions, the stock has now entered an oversold territory. Therefore, we advise traders to sell the stock only in the range of Rs 1,250 to Rs 1,270 for a target of Rs 1,150 in the coming 4-6 weeks.
