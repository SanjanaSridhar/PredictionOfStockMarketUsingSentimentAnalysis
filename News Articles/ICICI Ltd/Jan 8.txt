The Sensex continued to remain sluggish with negative bias on Tuesday, led by losses in metals, capital goods and technology sectors, in the absence of cues from global peers. The quarterly earnings, IIP figures and the Reserve Bank of India's policy meet are likely to give direction to the market in the short-term, say analysts. 
"The Sensex companies are expected to mirror the previous quarter with weak headline profit growth of 4.7 per cent on a consolidated basis. This is the weakest forecast in the last 13 quarters. Secondly, sales growth is also expected to be the slowest in last 13 quarters, re-enforcing the view of a slowdown," Jyotivardhan Jaipuria of BofA ML said. 
"Lastly, EBITDA margins, though lower by 130bps on a YoY basis, should bottom out in these 15 per cent - 16 per cent band. Among Sensex companies, ICICIBSE -1.17 % & HDFCBSE -1.90 % Bank, ITC, RILBSE -1.21 % and L&T are expected to be key contributors of growth. On the other hand, autos ( Tata MotorsBSE -0.97 %), ONGCBSE -3.28 %, BhartiBSE -1.58 % & InfosysBSE 16.90 % are expected to drag down growth. Marginal downgrades to FY13 EPS estimates are possible," he added.
