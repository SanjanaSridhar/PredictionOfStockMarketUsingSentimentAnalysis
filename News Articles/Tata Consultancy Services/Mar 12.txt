Indian shares fell for a second consecutive session on Tuesday, as interest rate-sensitive stocks retreated after better-than-expected factory data and
accelerating consumer inflation raised doubts about whether the central bank would ease monetary policy this month.

January industrial production rose at a stronger-than-expected 2.4% from a year earlier, expanding for the first time in three months, an early sign that Asia’s third-largest economy may have turned a corner.

Meanwhile, annual consumer price inflation accelerated to 10.91% in February from the previous month, government data showed.

Traders said wholesale price-based inflation data due on Thursday would be crucial for cementing final views on monetary easing ahead of the central bank’s policy review on 19 March.

“Market is waiting for WPI (wholesale price index) numbers and will take direction after RBI (Reserve Bank of India) meet,” said Vaibhav Sanghavi, director at Ambit Capital.

The benchmark BSE index, Sensex, closed down 0.41%, or 81.29 points, at 19,564.92.

The broader NSE index, the Nifty, fell 0.48%, or 28.25 points, to 5,914.10.

Stocks sensitive to interest rates fell after better-than-expected factory data and accelerating consumer inflation pared some of the rate cut hopes.

ICICI Bank Ltd fell 0.69%, while HDFC Bank Ltd was down 1.79%.

Among auto makers, Bajaj Auto Ltd fell 1.55%, while Hero MotoCorp Ltd ended 1.27% lower.

Information Technology stocks fell for the second day on profit booking after last week’s rally.

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd fell 0.28% while Infosys Ltd ended 1.11% lower.

Tata Power Co. Ltd fell 3.12% after Credit Suisse downgraded the stock to “underperform” from “neutral” and cut its target price to Rs.83 from Rs.104. The investment bank said Tata’s power plant being built in Mundra, should be operational in fiscal 2014, and that the company could post losses of Rs.1,500 crore-1,600 crore per annum in the initial years.

However among stocks that gained, MMTC Ltd rose 7.2% after the federal government postponed the planned sale of a 9.33% stake in the state-run trading company due to valuation issues.

MMTC shares had earlier fallen as much as 5.7% to a record low of Rs.280.05. The shares have slumped 53.5% so far this year as of Monday’s close on worries that the share sale would come at a steep discount.

Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd gained 0.45%, while those of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd rose 0.15% on expectations of additional inflows as both stocks could see an increase in their weightage in FTSE indexes after a rebalancing last week, according to Citigroup estimates.

FTSE last week announced a quarterly rebalancing across its indexes with changes due to take effect after the close of markets on Friday.
