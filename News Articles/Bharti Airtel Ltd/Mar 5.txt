ET Now: What is your call on the mid-tier pharma names? 

Ambareesh Baliga: In times like these people keep looking at safe havens and clearly pharma is one of them, FMCG, IT, OMCs these are three-four sectors where people will look for a place to park and in that possibly midcap pharma to a certain extent. Then those would be more like more riskier than as compared to possibly a Dr. Reddy or even a Ranbaxy at these levels. These are decently attractive and better bets than the smaller names. 

ET Now: What is your call on Bharti Airtel? 

Ambareesh Baliga: Whatever regulatory issues and most of negatives are like already priced in and I really do not see this stock cracking at 300-305 levels, like even we said we have seen this stock had gone closer to 300-305 and from there it has bounced back, currently even at 322 it is a buy because with the tariff hikes happening quite soon, you will have the stock possibly going back to the levels of 360-370 from where it had reversed.
