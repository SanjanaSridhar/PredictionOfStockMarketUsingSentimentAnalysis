 The government trashed allegations by mobile phone companies that it had extended 'undue benefits' to Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries (RIL) by allowing 4G spectrum holders to offer voice calls to customers by paying an additional Rs 1,658 crore for a pan-India licence.

RIL is the only company that has holds pan-India 4G permits. "The decision to allow 4G spectrum winners to offer voice by paying an additional Rs 1,658 crore was based on recommendations of both (sector regulator) Trai and the telecom commission. The regulator said that everyone should be allowed to migrate to a Unified Licence and then offer voice," telecom minister Kapil Sibal told ET.

He said that any government decision that 'increases competition and reduces tariffs was good for consumers', while adding that company (RIL) had bought 4G airwaves at market rates.

In a related development, RIL on Thursday slammed the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), the GSM-industry lobby, for opposing the policy that allows 4G spectrum winners to provide voice services, and said the industry body had 'misrepresented facts and misquoted the auction rules with the mala fide intent to mislead people and pressurise government into taking a lenient view on serious licence breaches by its members'.

The Mukesh Ambani-promoted telco also challenged incumbent operators to 'battle with competitors in the open market rather than indulge in disreputable practices'.

In its communication to telecom secretary R Chandrasekhar, RIL said that auction rules did not restrict it from migrating to any licence issued by the government. It further said that COAI had earlier supported the government's stance to charge Rs 1,658 crore for 4G players who wanted to offer voice and added that the 'sudden change of stance by the industry body was motivated'.
