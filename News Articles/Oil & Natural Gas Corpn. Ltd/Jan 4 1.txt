NEW DELHI: State-run oil marketing companies (OMCS) surged over 5 per cent in early trade on Friday on reports that the oil ministry proposes to increase fuel prices, particularly diesel, by less than a rupee per month. 

"The ministry has also proposed to reduce one-third subsidy on kerosene by 2014-15 and on cooking gas by a quarter this year, government officials said," ET reported. 

BPCLBSE 1.77 % surged over 2 per cent to hit its 52-week high of Rs 379.70 today. At 12:00 pm, BPCL was trading 2.8 per cent higher at Rs 376.75. 

HPCLBSE 5.57 % was trading 4.5 per cent higher at Rs 310.75. It has hit a low of Rs 296.55 and a high of Rs 312.25 in trade today. ONGCBSE 1.79 % was up 2.2 to Rs 286.05 and Oil IndiaBSE 2.21 % moved 3.6 per cent higher to Rs 488. 

The move is expected to reduce the government's subsidy burden substantially on diesel, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), officials said. 

Oil Marketing Companies are having a dream run backed by the expectations of the proposed norms raised by the Oil minister that is to hike diesel prices in a phased manner and eventually to deregulate the diesel prices to align with the market rates, experts say. 

"If the proposed criterion gets implemented will act as a boon for the OMCs(Viz; IOCBSE 3.82 %,BPCL,HPCL) as they are the ones inherently being the victim of under recoveries by selling their products at subsidized rates," says Soumyadip Raha, Executive Research-Oil & Gas at Microsec Capital Ltd. 

"Moreover this move will bring the more clarity on the OMCs financials as well as improve the overall health of the company," added Raha. 

However, Raha is of the view that possible logjam could be a hindrance in implementations of these reforms. 

"Rise in international crude oil prices coupled with Rupee depreciation against the USD resulted in higher under-recoveries for oil marketing companies (OMCs) on account of selling diesel, kerosene and domestic LPG at subsidized rates," Angel Broking said in a report. 

According to the oil ministry's recent data, state oil firms are losing Rs 9 a litre on diesel, Rs 30.60 on kerosene and Rs 490 per cylinder on cooking gas. 

The estimated fuel subsidy for 2012-13 is about Rs 166,000 crore, out of which the finance ministry has sanctioned Rs 30,000 crore and released the first installment of Rs 10,000 crore to state oil marketing firms this week. 

During the first half of December 2012, OMCs continued to lose Rs 411cr per day. OMCs lost Rs 9.3/liter, Rs 30.1/liter and Rs 521/cylinder on diesel, kerosene and domestic LPG, respectively. 

"The oil ministry is seeking more than Rs 100,000 crore from the finance ministry to compensate the three oil firms for selling fuel below market rates in the current fiscal year," added the ET report. 

State-run upstream companies such as ONGC and Oil India are expected to shoulder about Rs 55,000-crore subsidy burden this year. The marketing firms would absorb the balance, officials said.
