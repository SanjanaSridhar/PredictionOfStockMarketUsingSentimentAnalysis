The 50-share Nifty index rose over 0.2 per cent early on Thursday and is trading around its psychological level of 6000, supported by positive global cues. 
At 9:20 a.m., the 30-share BSE index was trading 0.05 per cent higher at 19,733. L&T (0.5 per cent), Tata Motors (0.27 per cent) and InfosysBSE 1.24 % (0.28 per cent) led the gainers pack. 
The Nifty was at 5,997.60, up 3.9 points or 0.07 per cent. It touched a high of 6017 and a low of 5,993.45 in early trade today. 
Jet AirwaysBSE 4.70 % surged over 6 per cent in early trade to hit its day's high of Rs 618.70 on the Bombay Stock Exchange after media reports suggested that the airliner is the front-runner for an investment by Gulf carrier Etihad Airways. The deal is likely to get completed in ten days, added reports. 
From last two trading sessions we have seen a gap up opening in the Nifty and now these gaps will act as a support for the next upmove, say experts. 
"As per the Fibonacci Retracement (high-5629/low-4770), Nifty is comfortably trading above 127% retracement levels and now its heading towards 161% i.e. 6150 levels," LKP Securities said in a report. 
"This indicates that uptrend is intact as long as it trades above the 5800 mark which is supported by the rising channel," the report added. 
LKP believes that it's a stock picker market as many stocks are on verge of technical breakout. Stock specific trading will prove more profitable in this market.
