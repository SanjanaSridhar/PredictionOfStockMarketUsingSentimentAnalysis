ET NOW:We were discussing about the potential of Reliance IndustriesBSE 1.51 % and ONGCBSE 1.95 % in this market. Do you think that Reliance still has what it takes to lead the market for the up move from here? 
Ambareesh Baliga: Absolutely. What I have been talking of in the past couple of months is the gas price revision for 2014 and with Rangarajan Committee report which clearly talks about $8 plus that could form the basis for the discussion for Reliance and that will be extremely positive. So even at the current levels it makes some sense buying Reliance looking at levels in case that goes through, pricing goes through, you could see levels of closer to 1050-1100. 
ET Now: What about ONGC? 
Ambareesh Baliga: ONGC still not very positive. It goes to levels of about 290-295 and then comes back so for that play one can look at buying but nothing beyond that.
