Tata Motors today introduced a warranty of four years on its entire range of heavy trucks with 25 tonnes and higher GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight).
With this, Tata Motors has become the first company in the country to offer a standard warranty of four years on heavy trucks, a clear reflection of the reliability and durability of Tata Motors trucks, company's Executive Director (Commercial Vehicles) Ravi Pisharody said here in a statement.
The warranty, applicable on the full range of tractor trailers, multi-axle trucks and tippers of 25 tonnes GVW, he said.
In addition, the warranty on the rest of the vehicle has been enhanced from 18 months to 24 months, Pisharody said.
Tata Motors accounts for two of every three tractor trailers, multi-axle trucks and tippers, with 25-tonne GVW or higher, sold in India, he said.
Pisharody said the four year's warranty is applicable on vehicles sold after January 6.
Tata Motors has designed the four-year standard warranty based on the lifecycle cost study of over 15 lakh Tata trucks and tippers operating all over the country, he said.
This extensive coverage, is backed by 'Tata Alert', a highway assistance programme for medium and heavy commercial vehicles, available across all national highways in India, Pisharody said.
Through Tata Alert", drivers will receive on-site breakdown assistance within four hours of dialing a toll-free helpline number (1800-209-7979), he said.
The 24x7 "Tata Alert" service will ensure that a vehicle is put back on the road within 48 hours from the time restoration work begins. In case of major repairs and the vehicle carrying perishable goods, 'Tata Alert' will provide load transfer assistance, Pisharody said.
