India’s Tata Motors Ltd said global sales in February fell 22.4% to 98,837 vehicles, the fourth consecutive monthly slide, as a 10% rise in sales at its key Jaguar Land Rover unit was undermined by a slump in its Tata-branded vehicles.

Jaguar Land Rover sales stood at 35,485 vehicles, Tata Motors said in a statement on Wednesday, up from 32,257 in the same month last year.

Sales of Tata Motors passenger vehicles stood at 11,177 during the month, down almost 70%. Tata, part of the salt-to-steel Tata Group conglomerate, said it sold 52,175 commercial vehicles in February, down an annual 9.8%.
