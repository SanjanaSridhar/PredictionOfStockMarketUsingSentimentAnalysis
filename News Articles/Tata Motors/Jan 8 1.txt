Launching the SUV, priced between Rs 10.04 lakh and Rs 14.12 lakh (ex-showroom Kolkata), Tata Motors utility vehicle product group head Ashesh Dhar said, "We are looking at a permanent role in the SUV market... We at present have a 12% market share and we are definitely seeing it increase".
In the last fiscal the company had sold about 16,000 Safaris, he said adding the SUV market is as present 5.7 lakh units and growing at an astounding rate of 50 per cent. 
The vehicle market is growing at about just 6-7%, he said.
