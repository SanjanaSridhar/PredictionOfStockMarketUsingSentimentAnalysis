Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd (HSBC) on Monday said profit before tax from India rose 14% in 2012 to $809 million, making it the third biggest contributor on this score.

India’s contribution was behind $7.16 billion profit from Hong Kong, which rose 24% from the year ago, and $1.12 billion from Brazil, up 6%.

The Indian profit for 2012 included the $314 million HSBC gained by selling stakes in two Indian banks—Yes Bank Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd—in June 2012. The so-called non-core assets were sold as part of HSBC’s plans to build reserves amid the financial crisis in Europe. HSBC owned a 4.75% stake in each bank through HSBC Iris Investments Mauritius Ltd.

In his statement to shareholders, HSBC group chairman Douglas Flint also announced that Infosys Ltd co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy had stepped down from the HSBC board at the end of 2012 after a five-year stint.
