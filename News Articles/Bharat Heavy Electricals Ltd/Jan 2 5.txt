MUMBAI: The Sensex held on to intraday gains and was hovering near the 19,700 mark on Wednesday, led by gains in capital goods, oil & gas, metals and banks, as sentiment in global markets turned positive after the US House of Representatives approved the 'fiscal cliff' bill that allows higher tax rates for individuals earning more than $400,000 a year and families earning more than $450,000 a year.

"We are positive on the markets from medium to long-term perspective. Valuations are not expensive and there is room for some more appreciation. Recovery in economy and corporate earnings should also help the market," independent market mnalyst Shrikant Shetty said.
