NEW DELHI: BHEL, Aditya Birla NuvoBSE 0.43 % surged over 1 per cent early on Wednesday after the government imposed 35% safeguard duty on electrical insulators imported from China.

"The safeguard duty on certain insulators would be for a period of two years -- 35 per cent for first year and 25 per cent in subsequent year, according to the Revenue Department," PTI reported. 
PTI report quoting Directorate General of Safeguards (Customs & Central Excise) said: "It will be in the public interest to impose safeguard duty on import of electrical insulators from People's Republic of China." 
The probe came after the domestic industry had argued that all major Indian players have sufficient swappable capacity and can cater the country's demand right up to 1,200 KV. Chinese producers are quoting predatory prices purely to increase their share of the Indian market.
