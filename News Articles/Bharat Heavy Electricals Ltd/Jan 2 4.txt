Ambareesh Baliga: Yes in fact I see the investment cycle actually turning around and cap good space like EMCOBSE -0.92 % should really do well. So, it is just not EMCO, overall cap good space, it is still time to pick up because the way I see the next two-three months there should be good order flows and most of the stocks should give extremely good returns. My top pick here is like L&T, BHELBSE 1.76 %, BGR EnergyBSE -0.76 %.
