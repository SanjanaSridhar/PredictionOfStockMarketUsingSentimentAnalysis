MUMBAI: The Sensex extended overnight gains and was comfortably place above 19,700 mark on the back of positive news flow from the US. The "fiscal cliff" crisis was finally averted after the House of Representatives approved a Senate bill that raised tax for the rich and delayed spending cuts. 
Barack Obama, President of the USA, will sign Fiscal Cliff Bill passed by Congress. He said that the bill will help to hike government's revenue by $600 billion. 
"Now that we have passed it (fiscal cliff issue), we will once again focus back on many of our domestic events which are lined up in the course of this month. We will probably look forward to the interest rate action from the RBI," said Taher Badshah, Senior Vice President & Co-Head Equities, Motilal Oswal Asset Management in an interview to ET Now.
