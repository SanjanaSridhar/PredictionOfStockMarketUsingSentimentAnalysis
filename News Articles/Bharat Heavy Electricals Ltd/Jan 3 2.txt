NEW DELHI: Having witnessed a 26 per cent rise in 2012, the Sensex can further go up by 15-20 per cent in 2013, backed by strong earnings growth, global liquidity, fall in interest rates and further reforms. 
Nirmal Jain, chairman, India InfolineBSE -1.41 %, believes that the market may deliver another 15-20 per cent return this year, backed by government reforms and liquidity flows. 
"So we will look at 12-14 per cent earnings growth in fiscal 2014, but if 2014-2015 looks like 15-20 per cent earnings growth, the market will tend to discount that in this calendar year," he added. 
Even after attracting $25 billion in foreign flows in 2012, the benchmark index is trading at a lower multiple compared to its 10-year average, according to analysts. 
The current P/E of Sensex stands at 16.7x on TTM basis (Source: Bloomberg) compared to its 10-year average of 18.52x. 
Siddharth Sedani, AVP (Portfolio Management Service) at Microsec Capital Ltd, is of the view that there is always a scope of P/E expansion on the back of further policy action and the repo cut by the RBI during the year. 
The benchmark index generated a return of over 25 per cent in 2012, but most analysts feel there is more steam left in the markets. However, risk-reward ratio at the current juncture seems less favorable. 
"Investors should focus on those stocks rather than the index, which have visibility of earnings with cheap/reasonable valuation on every dip," Sedani added. 
According to BSE data, the Sensex has managed to record a P/E greater than its historic average at least 4 times in the past 10 years. 
Most analysts are of the view that earnings are likely to grow in FY14, which should give support to large P/E multiple. "In addition to policy action, earnings have to support the P/E expansion to justify the growth subsequently," Sedani added. 
"Stock picking has become far more difficult today. However, there is no reason to be negative at this point because valuations are still reasonable," told Vetri Subramaniam, Chief Investment Officer, Religare Mutual Fund, in an interview with ET Now. 
"On valuations, I don't think we are still in the territory where I would call it as being stretched because we are still trading slightly lower than the 15-year average trailing PE multiples," he added. 
Even though major indices surged over 25 per cent in the year 2012 supported by huge liquidity inflows, market experts are advising investors to take all positives with a pinch of salt. 
The economy still faces several challenges, which are likely to continue in 2013. If we look at some of the recent data that has come out, either in terms of auto sales or in terms of cement sales, all of that suggest that the economy is still pretty sluggish. 
"Opportunities have become far more difficult to come by this year compared to last year. So, we see a far more challenging year ahead for the market, but there is no reason to be negative at this point because valuations are still reasonable," added Subramaniam. 
HSBC in its latest research report has said the Sensex is likely to extend the bull run and touch its all-time high of 21,700 by the year-end. However, if we observe carefully, the rise is a mere 11 per cent compared to a 25 per cent jump in 2012. 
The Sensex had scaled an all-time high of 21,206.77 on January 10, 2008. 
Stocks and sectors to watch out in 2013: 
According to Sedani of Microsec Capital, many beaten down PSU stocks like NMDCBSE 0.65 % and BHELBSE 1.76 % are a compelling buy at current levels due to cheap valuations and magnitude of the business. 
"The banking sector is one space where we could see some outperformance in the private banks. In addition to that, cement is another space which looks positive," said Nipun Mehta of Blue Ocean Capital Advisors. 
"Pharma is another space which could see improved performance as well as metals," added Mehta.
