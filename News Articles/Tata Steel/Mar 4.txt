The BSE Metal Index has hit a low of 8914, its lowest level since May 2009, in intra-day trade so far on rising concerns of high inventory levels because of poor offtake amid economic slowdown locally while exports have been impacted by lower imports from China, the world's largest consumer of metals.So far in current calendar year 2013, the metal index has down by almost 18% against less than 3% drop in Sensex.
Globally, LMEX, a gauge of six metals traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME), fell 1.35% to 3,340.60 on Friday, March 1, 2013.
