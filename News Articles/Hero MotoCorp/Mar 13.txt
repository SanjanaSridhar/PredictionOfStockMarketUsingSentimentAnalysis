Indian shares posted their biggest daily fall this month on Wednesday, as interest rate-sensitive stocks such as ICICI Bank Ltd continued to retreat a day before key inflation data that could help determine whether the central bank would ease monetary policy.

Declines in global markets also weighed on shares, which have fallen each day this week, retreating from the one-month high hit on Friday as a rally has run out of steam.

India’s wholesale prices in February likely rose 6.54%, their slowest annual pace in more than three years, a Reuters poll showed, strengthening the chances of a rate cut.

The data came ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) policy review on 19 March. Although investors are hoping for a rate cut, data this week showing stronger-than-expected industrial output and accelerating consumer inflation has clouded the picture.

“WPI (Wholesale Price Index-based) inflation would be a key factor ahead of RBI meeting on 19 March to decide the near term trend,” said Aneesh Srivastava, chief investment officer at IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co. Ltd, who oversees Rs.3,000 crore worth of assets in capital markets.

“Until inflation falls significantly RBI can duck the rate cuts for March citing current account and CPI (Consumer Price Index) pressures,” added Srivastava.

The benchmark BSE index, Sensex, fell 1.03%, or 202.37 points, to end at 19,362.55, marking its biggest single day fall since 28 February, and erasing part of a four-day rally seen last week.

The broader NSE index, the Nifty, fell 1.06%, or 62.90 points, to end at 5,851.20, closing below the psychologically important 5,900 level.

ICICI Bank fell 3.25% while mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) ended 1.77% lower, as doubts grew about whether the RBI will cut interest rates.

Among other decliners, Tata Motors Ltd fell 1.15% after the auto maker said global sales in February fell 22.4%, the fourth consecutive monthly slide. Among other auto stocks, Bajaj Auto Ltd fell 3.16%, while Hero MotoCorp Ltd ended 0.38% lower on persisting concerns about slowing sales.

Dish TV India Ltd fell 1.56% after Reuters reported that US private equity firm Apollo Global Management Llc is in talks to sell its 11% stake in the company, citing two sources with direct knowledge of the development.

However, among stocks that gained, Jet Airways (India) Ltd rose 1.19%, marking a fourth day of gains, on unconfirmed market talk of a potential sale of parking slots in Brussels to Etihad Airways, dealers said.
