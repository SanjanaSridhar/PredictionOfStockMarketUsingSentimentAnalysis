Indian shares fell to near three-month lows on Monday as global risk aversion sparked broad-based selling in domestic blue chips, including in Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) and Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, at a time when sentiment is already weak.

European shares, the euro and oil prices all fell on Monday as political stalemate in the US and Italy and China’s plans for tighter controls on its property sector hit sentiment.

The global uncertainty has come on the heels of broad disappointment over the 2013/14 budget unveiled on Thursday and weak October-December growth data, with investors expecting a rebound in markets if the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cuts interest rates later this month.

“After an ordinary budget, RBI policy would certainly be the next trigger to watch, but risks have gone up marginally in US and Europe, which will have implications on allocations towards India as well,” said Aneesh Srivastava, chief investment officer at IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co. Ltd, who oversees Rs.2,900 crore in assets. Slowing growth and ballooning deficit are also hurting the market sentiment, Srivastava added.

The benchmark BSE index, Sensex, fell 0.21%, or 40.56 points, to end at 18,877.96, near its lowest close since 27 November hit on Thursday.
The broader NSE index, the Nifty, fell 0.37%, or 21.20 points, to end at 5,698.50, closing below the psychologically important 5,700 level.
